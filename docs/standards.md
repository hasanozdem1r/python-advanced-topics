## Commit Convention
Writing a code commit is very critical when it comes to debugging or analyzing colleagues work.
I follow this [standards](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit message

## Pre-Commit Hooks
The pre-commit hook is run first, before you even type in a commit message. It's used to inspect the snapshot that's about to be committed, to see if you've forgotten something, to make sure tests run, or to examine whatever you need to inspect in the code.

## Coding Style Guide

A style guide tells a developer how to work with a particular programming language. Programming style guides are composed of rules and guidance. Rules are mandates, with very few exceptions, enforceable throughout the entire IT organization. Rules make good and bad programming behavior explicit.

In Python most common ones [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf)

## DevOps Pipeline
Set of automated processes and tools that allows both developers and operations professionals to work cohesively to build and deploy code to a production environment.

I am using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) which solve almost everything but there are more tools in the market such as Jenkins, CircleCI
