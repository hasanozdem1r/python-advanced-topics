# EAFP -> easier to ask forgiveness than permission -> Handling errors after they occur
"""
You can either prevent errors before they happen or handle errors after they’ve happened
    1.Prevent errors or exceptional situations from happening
    2.Handle errors or exceptional situations after they happen

Look before you leap. This coding style explicitly tests for pre-conditions before making calls or lookups.
This style contrasts with the EAFP approach and is characterized by the presence of many if statements.
